People get certain diseases because of genetic changes . 
When we are diagonosed with a certain genetic disease , are we supposed to disclose this result to our relatives ?     
Nothing is absolute right or wrong .
Sometimes some family structure and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication .
People with close blood relationships generally carry some similar genes . 
Secondly , genetic disease has a close relationship with the born gene together with their daily habits .
Firstly , someone has what kind of disease belongs to his or her private .     
Privicy protection belongs to one's human rights .     
The law's spirit also includes fairness . 
Firstly , what is the range of relatives ? 
In the age of rapid technological advancement , a lot of medical breakthroughs have been made possible .  
This essay will discuss whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not . 
Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring any pessimism into their family . 
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or to take some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease . 
For a genetic risk carrier , there should be choice given with regards to informing his/her relatives .
They should not be forced or obligied to do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier .
In addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it is been made known to them .
Other than that , I believe that the strong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support to the carrier . 
I think the family will stay as mentally healthy as it is , without having emotional stress .  
Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more care towards the carrier of a known genetic risk . 
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
These are the most essential elements to overcoming challenges .   
If they do not want to think too much about it and view it as a problem , they may just ignore the possibility . 
Otherwise , making it an obligation will restric the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .     
The basis of a family is that everyone trusts and loves each other without doubt .   
Not only the child but also the entire family will suffer . 
The most obvious reason for those who argue for this opinion is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases .
He or she might even be advised not to get married or have children .
