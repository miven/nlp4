People get certain diseases because of genetic changes .
When we are diagnosed with a certain genetic disease , are we supposed to disclose this result to our relatives ?
Nothing is absolutely right or wrong .
Sometimes some family structures and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication .
People with close a blood relationship generally carry some similar genes .
Secondly , genetic disease has a close relationship with the birth gene together with their daily habits .
Firstly , someone having any kind of disease belongs to his or her privacy .
Privacy protection belongs to one's human rights .
The law's spirit also includes fairness .
Firstly , what is the range of relatives ?
In an age of rapid technological advancement , a lot of medical breakthroughs are made possible .
This essay will discuss whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not .
Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring any pessimism into their family .
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or to take some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease .
For a genetic risk carrier , there should be a choice given with regards to informing his/her relatives .
They should not be forced or obliged to do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier .
In addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it has been made known to them .
Other than that , I believe that the strong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support to the carrier .
I think the family will stay mentally healthy as it is , without having emotional stress .
Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more care towards the carrier of a known genetic risk .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk of a disorder .
That is the most essential element to overcome the challenges .
If they do not want to think too much about it and view it as a problem , they may just ignore the possibility .
Otherwise , making it an obligation will restrict the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
The basis of a family is that everyone trusts and loves each other with no doubts .
Not only the child but also the entire family will suffer .
The most obvious reason of those who argue for this opinion is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases .
He or she might even be advised not to get married or have children .
Even though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to be alert to avoid getting the disease .
It is almost impossible for us to keep away from it .
Besides that , these skills require time to develop and adapt .
For people who are living very far from one another , the intensive use of social media is justified .
It also helps people to develop their interpersonal skills through online chatting .
I met some Canadian friends in Egypt .
However , critics may argue that not all information or news disseminated is reliable .
Therefore , with the help of technology , people are able to catch up with each other conveniently .
However , in order for people to maintain their relationships as well as make new friends , it requires mutual trust and understanding between both parties .
Photos and information retrieved from their profile page may be fabricated to suit a personal agenda .
These are some concrete examples of how social media reduce face-to-face human contact .
All of us are living in a technology realm society .
This means that the students are not concentrating when they are supposed to do so .
However , we are able to chat with our friends without travelling to the countries .
I believe most of us have the experience of suddenly forgetting how to write a word that we should know .
The use of social media has greatly influenced our ways of communicating with one another .
However , after one has registered on those social media sites which are not reliable , all the information you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future .
We should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact our family or friends .
The communication is also not limited to words .
People even prefer to talk to their friends and meet their friends online and gradually reject face-to-face communication .
People do not know how to talk with others face to face , especially strangers .
Young people can widen their relationships , meet new friends and learn wonderful things about many parts of the world .
In conclusion , there are both advantages and disadvantages in using social media in daily life .
One advantage is that it is more convenient to contact others by social media .
We communicate with others using social media , such as Twitter , Facebook and microblog more and more frequently .
Some will take a long time and some are not efficient enough for people to get their response .
First of all , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other .
It makes people feel extremely close to their admirers' lives and works .
Indeed , people go to great lengths to make their words as short as they can .
Social media provide with people a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communicating .
This saves a lot of time for me reading newspapers and watching TV .
I get news about sales , clothes and cosmetics from my friends .
Risks can be analyzed if there is a record of what happened in the past .

Pets are supposed to be chained when they are out in the streets .
This shows that even though there is a risk of causing harm to someone , people still prefer to bear the risk and allow their pets to have maximum freedom .
This greatly violates the rights of people .
For example , one person wants to visit his friend's place in a new city .
In that case , they would have no choice but to seek the power of loyal police .
The detective will start investigating the first criminal scene and brainstorm for all the possibilities .
If RFID comes into existence , this kind of case can be totally avoided in no time .
At that time , Singapore government adopted the method to install surveillance in every patient's home to look after their actions .
Every coin has two sides .

It is convenient for customers to track and confirm where and how their goods are now .
However , tracking people is difficult and different from goods .
Since the inventory management is very important for some kinds of companies , this technology is playing a very significant role .
Although in many respects , this technology can be used in positive and evidently beneficial ways , in some areas it is so controversial .
By using this card , our identities can be confirmed and the information of a certain institution can be kept .
What should be a concern is how it can be applied in the right area in a right way .
Having power can help people to achieve lots of things ; however , abusing will guide us another direction .
This clearly illustrates how a corrupt government may breach its civilians' privacy .
With the development of technology , we have more advanced methods to track people in today's society .
Policeman can just go to a certain place and chase the criminal .
With the development of science and technology , surveillance technology is playing its role in people's lives .
Rising life expectancy is a two-sided sword which is both a challenge and an achievement .
This is a challenge as it reduces the productivity of countries , and hence affects the productivity of the world .
Land space will be limited when more hospices are built to take care of the elderly people .
With the population ageing problem getting more and more serious all over the world , the shortage of various kinds of resources challenge most of the countries in the world .
An individual is an unit of the society , every good individual thus is a precious contribution to the society's and nation's growth .
Much more could be done to reach the stage of extending the lifespan of human beings .
To raise life expectancy , one of the questions is how to upgrade the current medical system .
This is due to the improvements and breakthroughs in the realm of medicine and people's living condition .
Life expectancy can be defined as a desired level of service or better technology to make one's life more comfortable .
They are expecting better medication , healthier food , and a cleaner environment and so on and so forth .
There are millions of doctors all over the world , but there are billions of patients as well .
It may be a challenge but also a golden opportunity to educate children properly to prevent undesired outcomes .
Besides that , an ageing population has an important and essential thing that we can not buy in cash .
With a low birth rate , Singapore is bringing in foreigners to maintain the population to maintain the efficiency and development of the country .
If a country can bear an ageing population , it is a thing that the country can be proud of .
It is a break-through in technology and science , and an outstanding achievement of human wisdom .
There is no absolutely perfect way , so we have done a good job on the road .
Better sanitation will result in fewer deaths by infection and significantly reduce the spread of diseases and viruses .
Advanced healthcare is also a major factor in prolonging an individual 's existence on earth .
Rising life expectancy is a technological achievement .
Statistics show that worldwide , the average life expectancy at birth was 66.57 years for 2009 according to CIA World Factbook 2009 .
Japanese society is now facing a severe ageing problem , and the path of development is seriously slowed .
These two words can be seen in various media and assessments of this social trend are of great number .
For the whole society , rising life expectancy are a symbol of more advanced science and technology especially in the medical field , better social environment and a safer world .
For a few groups of families , there are even up to eight old people since their grandparents are also living with them .
For society , when the group of old people becomes larger and less people can work for the society , this society may lack of labourers .
